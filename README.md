Using a Linear Model to Predict Product Ratings
===============================================

Recommendation systems are machine learningâ€“based software systems that attempt to predict the rating that a user might give a particular item; if the predicted rating is high, the item is then recommended to the user. For this study, a linear model to predict product ratings was built and tested using a publicly-available data set. This model employed regularization to dampen the effect that outliers in the data would have. The model achieved an RMSE of 0.8651948 on the holdout data set. This work highlights the advantage of identifying additional features and introducing additional terms when constructing linear models for prediction systems.
